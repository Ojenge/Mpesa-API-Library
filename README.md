# Mpesa-API Library

This is part of my giving back to the community. Since the Mpesa Api was released, no one has developed any public library which developers can use.
Being a developer i decided to look into the documentation and create an initial library which other developers can contribute to.
This library provide all the features provided by the Mpesa Api.
